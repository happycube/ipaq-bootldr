                Bootldr</h1>

                <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

                <p>The bootloader firmware (bootldr)  is the program that
                first gets control of the machine when it is powered on.   The
                bootloader initializes and manages the raw hardware.  One of
                its main jobs is to copy the operating system from
                non-volatile memory (Flash) to DRAM and pass control to the
                operating system.  The bootloader performs platform specific
                hardware configuration for the operating system, such as
                steering interrupts on the PCI devices (on Skiff only).</p>

                <p>In addition, the bootloader provides a simple command-line
                interface that allows the user to download new versions of the
                operating system, user code, and parameters into Flash via the
                XMODEM or YMODEM protocols.</p>

                <p>The following is the list of bootloader commands.</p>

                <h2><a name="Command List">Command List</a></h2>
                <dl>
                  <dt><strong>help</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The help command lists all the supported commands
                      along with a very brief description of their
                    syntax.</dd>
                    <dd><code>help</code></dd>
                    <dd><code>help &lt;cmdname></code></dd>
                    <dd><code>&lt;cmdname> help</code></dd>
                  <dt><strong>load</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The <code>load</code> command downloads files into
                      DRAM or Flash using the XMODEM or YMODEM protocol.
		      The most common uses of <code>load</code> are to
		      install new versions of the kernel, user code, or the
		      bootloader itself.  The syntax for these forms is
		      shown below:
                      <dl>
                        <dt><a name="load kernel"><code>load
                        kernel</code></a></dt>
                          <dd>This command will install a new version of the
                            NetBSD or Linux kernel (uncompressed or compressed
                            with gzip).  The kernel file can be up to 30800192
                            bytes. (3MB - 64KB).</dd>
                        <dt><a name="load bootldr"><code>load
                        bootldr</code></a></dt>
                          <dd>Installs a copy of the bootloader (which may be
                            up to 48KB). <strong>Use with extreme
                            caution</strong>.   If a non-functional bootloader
                            is installed, the bootloader will have to be
                            reinstalled via the JTAG Test Access Port.</dd>
                        <dt><a name="load ramdisk"><code>load
                        ramdisk</code></a></dt>
                          <dd>Installs a copy of the linux initial ramdisk
                            (which may be up to 3MB).  Only for use with
                            Linux.</dd>
                        <dt><a name="load params"><code>load
                        params</code></a></dt>
                          <dd>Installs up to 16KB of boot parameters.  One
                            parameter stored in this section is the serial
                            port baudrate.</dd>

                         <dd>Installs a Journalling Flash File System
                           image. Only available when JFFS support has
                           been compiled in.</dd>

                          <dd>This is an advanced command.  Downloads a file
                            to Flash at the indicated offset from the start of
                            Flash.  Erases all the affected sectors. Use with
                            caution, because it is possible to inadvertently
                            overwrite the kernel or ramdisk using this
                            command..</dd>

                <strong>profile</strong>.   Lines prefixed with "bootldr:" are
                read and evaluated as bootldr commands beforing booting a
                kernel.  Lines prefixed with "profile:" are read and sourced
                by the NetBSD .profile.</p>

                <p>It is easiest to manage the params section by using the
                params command described above, but this only works if the
                bootldr is the only software using the params section.</p>

               <h3><a name="Assabet">Intel Assabet and Neponset</a></h3>

               <p>Support for the Intel StrongARM SA-1110
               Microprocessor Development board (<em>Assabet</em>)
               and the Intel StrongARM SA-1111 Microprocessor
               Development Module (<em>Neponset</em>) was added on 22
               November, 2000.</p>

               <p>The <em>Assabet</em> hardware is similar to
               <em>Bitsy</em> in a number of ways that are relevant
               to the bootldr, such as memory initialization or the
               use of SA-1110 on-chip UARTs for serial
               communication. One special convention which is
               described in the hardware manuals for the development
               boards concerns UART selection: when <em>Assabet</em>
               is used alone, UART1 is the main console serial
               port. When <em>Neponset</em> is present, UART3
               (accessible via port J20 on the companion board)
               becomes the console port (and the <em>Assabet</em>
               RS232 transceiver is shut down).</p>

               <p>The bootldr is aware of the presence or absence of
               <em>Neponset</em> when running on <em>Assabet</em>,
               and configures the appropriate UART. The Linux kernel
               also respects this convention, and includes the same
               companion board detection logic. The default bit rate
               for either UART is 115200bps; make sure that your
               kernel and userland programs (such as <em>getty</em>)
               are configured appropriately.</p>

               <p>The <em>Assabet</em> bill of materials claims that
               the board is shipped with Intel 28F128J3A
               (StrataFlash) flash memories. Some configurations of
               the board actually include the smaller 28F160B3 boot
               block flash components, for a total bank 0 size of
               4MB. The bootldr includes support for both parts.</p>

               <p>When compiling bootldr for <em>Assabet</em>, be
               sure to edit the file <code>config.mk</code> to
               include the definition,
               <code>CONFIG_ARCH=assabet</code>.</p>

               <h2><a name="JFFS">Journalling Flash File System</a></h2>

               <p>Support for the Journalling Flash File System
               (JFFS) was added on 22 November, 2000.</p>

               <p>The bootldr provides the ability to access and boot
               from a JFFS partition on flash memory. This feature
               can be useful because it permits easy upgrades of the
               kernel, and because it eliminates the need for a
               separate kernel partition in the flash device. A user
               may simply provide the name of the boot image in the
               filesystem, and the bootldr will construct the file in
               main memory, then execute it.</p>

               <p>JFFS is a log-structured filesystem which is <a
               href="http://handhelds.org/z/wiki/JFFS">documented on
               the handhelds.org Wiki</a>. The log-based nature of
               the filesystem requires the bootldr to "replay" a list
               of updates to any file before use. The unsorted
               sequence of updates on flash necessitates a "scan" of
               the device before the filesystem can be accessed. This
               scan occurs once during the first filesystem access,
               and is not repeated unless the bootldr reprograms the
               JFFS partition. Note that the scan is only performed
               to determine final file metadata, such as file size or
               name; no files are actually reconstructed until asked
               for. Once a file is reconstructed (for any reason),
               the built file is cached in memory and is not
               reconstructed for subsequent accesses. Commands which
               cause file reconstruction include
               <code>boot&nbsp;jffs</code>,
               <code>peek&nbsp;jffs</code> (with a pathname
               argument), and <code>md5sum</code>. Note that
               <code>peek jffs</code> with an inode number argument
               does not cause any reconstruction to occur.</p>

               <p>When writing a JFFS image (such as one constructed
               by <em>mkfs.jffs</em>) to the flash memories, it is
               recommended that the image be padded with
               <code>0xff</code> bytes out to the size of the
               partition. JFFS does not include an end-of-log
               delimiter, and can accidentally misinterpret logs left
               over from an earlier filesystem at the end of the
               device. These "left over" logs can confuse the
               bootldr, which will refuse to replay any filesystem it
               finds to be inconsistent.</p>

               <p>If you suspect that the bootldr has improperly
               reconstructed a file, such as a kernel image, use the
               <code>md5sum</code> command to compare against a known
               correct message digest. If the digests do not match,
               find the inumber of the file by using the
               <code>ls</code> command, and then send the output of
               <code>peek&nbsp;jffs&nbsp;<em>&lt;inumber&gt;</em></code>
               to <a href="mailto:john+@cs.cmu.edu">John Dorsey</a>,
               along with a text history of the actions which have
               been performed on that file.</p>

               <h2><a name="bootldr.conf">bootldr.conf</a></h2>

               <p>Support for <em>bootldr.conf</em> was added on 26
               November, 2000.</p>

               <p>There are two ways to boot a kernel from a
               Journalling Flash File System partition: specify a
               bootable file in the filesystem, or provide the label
               of a boot image block from a configuration file. The
               former approach is straightforward; simply set the
               bootldr param <code>boot_file</code> to the absolute
               path of a bootable image (or pass the filename to
               <code>boot&nbsp;jffs</code>). The latter approach
               offers easier customization, as the entire boot
               configuration can be edited while the operating system
               is running; only a reboot is necessary to pick up the
               changes.</p>

               <p>Boot configuration is based on the contents of a
               file in the JFFS flash partition. The name of this
               file is stored in the bootldr param
               <code>conf_file</code>, and by default has the value
               "<code>/etc/bootldr.conf</code>". The contents of this
               file will be familiar to users of <em>lilo</em>, as
               the syntax and keywords were all taken directly from
               the Linux Loader used on the i386 architecture. Here
               is an example file:</p>

               <blockquote><code>
               <p>default=linux</p>
               
               <p>read-write</p>

               <p>image=/boot/zImage-test<br />
               <blockquote>
               label=test<br />
               root=/dev/mtdblock1<br />
               read-only<br />
               literal="noinitrd console=0"<br />
               </blockquote></p>

               <p>image=/boot/zImage<br />
               <blockquote>
               label=linux<br />
               alias=good<br />
               root=/dev/mtdblock1<br />
               append="console=0"<br />
               </blockquote></p>

               </code></blockquote>

               <p>As with <em>lilo</em>, the configuration file is
               partitioned into sections. Any directives up to the
               first <code>image</code> keyword become part of the
               global scope, and will apply to any image block unless
               overshadowed. Image blocks contain directives which
               apply only to the kernel named in the
               <code>image</code> statement. All directives within an
               image block are scoped to that image until a new image
               block begins with an <code>image</code> statement.</p>

               <p>In general, keywords can appear in either global or
               image scope. The exceptions are <code>default</code>
               (which can only be global) and <code>literal</code>
               (which can only be image-local). When a keyword is
               used in both global and image-local scope, the local
               value overshadows the global value. The exception is
               <code>append</code>, which simply appends the local
               value to the global value when building the kernel
               argument list.</p>

               <p>Only one directive may appear per line. Other than
               this constraint, whitespace is ignored when parsing
               the file. (The indentation in the example file is only
               used to improve readability.) To preserve spaces (or
               the character `<code>=</code>', which has a special
               meaning during tokenization) in string literals,
               enclose them in quotation marks.</p>

               <p>The <code>boot_file</code> param can be set to the
               label or alias of an image to boot. If this param has
               no value, then the first image parsed will be booted
               by default, unless another image is specified using
               the <code>default</code> keyword.</p>

               <p>The accepted keywords are described below. The
               legal scopes of each keyword are denoted by
               <strong>G</strong> for global, and <strong>L</strong>
               for image-local.</p>

               <dd>Specify an alternative name by which this image
