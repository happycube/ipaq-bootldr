ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

<h2>Prinicipals of Operation</h2>

<p>The bootldr is firmware -- it is the first code executed by the processor
when it comes out of reset, whether reset was induced by turning on power to
the device or by hitting the reset switch.</p>

<p>The first word of the bootldr image is loaded at the beginning of Flash so
that it will be executed when the processor comes out of reset.  Usermode
programs and even the kernel have some other program that interprets the
executable and loads the code into memory at the appropriate point.  These
often have executable file headers that describe where to load them into
memory.  The bootldr does not have this luxury -- it is the one that loads the
kernel.  For this reason, the Makefile for the bootldr does some funny things
to ensure that the first word of the bootldr is a valid instruction.</p>

<h3>Memory Mapping</h3>

<p>With one exception, the bootldr uses a linear identity mapping from virtual
to physical addresses.</p>

<p>The exception is that the first 1MB of Flash is copied into DRAM, and the
virtual address corresponding to the first 1MB of Flash is mapped to this
image in DRAM.</p>

<p>This is done in mmu-strongarm.c, before setting up the MMU the bootldr
copies itself into DRAM .</p>

<p>Flash and DRAM are mapped cacheable, and bufferable.</p>

<p>The second exception to the identity virtual->physical mapping is that a
second uncacheable mapping is created for Flash.  This is necessary so taht
the bootldr can program flash.  However, booting the kernel is faster if there
is a  cacheable image of Flash to read the kernel and possibly ramdisk from.
Since we boot more often than write flash,  it's the uncached image that is
non-identity.</p>

<h3>Signature of the Bootldr</h3>

<p>The bootldr contains a number of elements that identify it as a valid,
uncorrupted bootldr.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>BOOTLDR_MAGIC (0x646c7462)</dt>
    <dd>Identifies this file as a bootldr.  It appears at offset 0x20 because
      this is the first free location after the exception vector jump
    table.</dd>
  <dt>BOOTLDR_VERSION</dt>
    <dd>Identifies the version number of the bootldr image</dd>
  <dt>BOOTLDR_START</dt>
    <dd>Specifies where this bootldr should be loaded in memory.  This is used
      to distinguish between bootldr images for SA110/Footbridge and SA1100,
      which have Flash at different offsets.  We should probably add
      BOOTLDR_ARCHITECTURE.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Safeguards</h3>

<p>After linking, the bootldr image is padded with bytes so that the checksum
of the image is zero.  It is padded with zeros to a multiple of 128 bytes so
that the checksum of the image after xmodem download is still zero.</p>
